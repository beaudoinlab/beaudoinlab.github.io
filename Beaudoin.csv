During the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), thousands of maternal transcripts are regulated. However, how different cis-elements and trans-factors  are integrated to determine mRNA stability remains poorly understood. Here, we show that most transcripts are under combinatorial regulation by multiple decay pathways during zebrafish MZT. By using a massively parallel reporter assay, we identified cis-regulatory sequences in the 3' UTR, including U-rich motifs that are associated with increased mRNA stability. In contrast, miR-430 target sequences, UAUUUAUU AU-rich elements (ARE), CCUC, and CUGC elements emerged as destabilizing motifs, with miR-430 and AREs causing mRNA deadenylation upon genome activation. We identified trans-factors by profiling RNA-protein interactions and found that poly(U)-binding proteins are preferentially associated with 3' UTR sequences and stabilizing motifs. We show that this activity is antagonized by C-rich motifs and correlated with protein binding. Finally, we integrated these regulatory motifs into a machine learning model that predicts reporter mRNA stability in vivo.","2019-07","2019-09-07 18:28:29","2019-09-07 18:28:29","","1100-1114","","7","29","","Genome Res","","","","","","","","eng","(c) 2019 Vejnar et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.","","","","","","PMID: 31227602  PMCID: PMC6633259","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the mechanisms that activate the silent genome after fertilization are poorly understood. Here, we show that transcriptional competency is regulated by Brd4- and P300-dependent histone acetylation in zebrafish. Live imaging of transcription revealed that genome activation, beginning at the miR-430 locus, is gradual and stochastic. We show that genome activation does not require slowdown of the cell cycle and is regulated through the translation of maternally inherited mRNAs. Among these, the enhancer regulators P300 and Brd4 can prematurely activate transcription and restore transcriptional competency when maternal mRNA translation is blocked, whereas inhibition of histone acetylation blocks genome activation. We conclude that P300 and Brd4 are sufficient to trigger genome-wide transcriptional competency by regulating histone acetylation on the first zygotic genes in zebrafish. This mechanism is critical for initiating zygotic development and developmental reprogramming.","2019-06-17","2019-09-07 18:28:29","2019-09-07 18:28:29","","867-881.e8","","6","49","","Dev Cell","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we characterized mRNA structure dynamics during zebrafish development. We observed that on a global level, translation guides structure rather than structure guiding translation. We detected a decrease in structure in translated regions and identified the ribosome as a major remodeler of RNA structure in vivo. In contrast, we found that 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) form highly folded structures in vivo, which can affect gene expression by modulating microRNA activity. Furthermore, dynamic 3'-UTR structures contain RNA-decay elements, such as the regulatory elements in nanog and ccna1, two genes encoding key maternal factors orchestrating the maternal-to-zygotic transition.

We observed that guanine enrichment and adenine depletion increased sgRNA stability and activity, whereas  differential sgRNA loading, nucleosome positioning and Cas9 off-target binding were not major determinants. We also identified sgRNAs truncated by one or two nucleotides and containing 5' mismatches as efficient alternatives to canonical sgRNAs. On the basis of these results, we created a predictive sgRNA-scoring algorithm, CRISPRscan, that effectively captures the sequence features affecting  the activity of CRISPR-Cas9 in vivo. Finally, we show that targeting Cas9 to the  germ line using a Cas9-nanos 3' UTR led to the generation of maternal-zygotic mutants, as well as increased viability and decreased somatic mutations.

Because they are associated with a variety of biological cellular  mechanisms, these fascinating structural motifs are seen as potential therapeutic targets against many diseases. While screening of chemical compounds specific to  G4 motifs has yielded interesting results, no single compound successfully discriminates between G4 motifs based on nucleotide sequences alone. This level of specificity is best attained using antisense oligonucleotides (ASO). Indeed, oligonucleotide-based strategies are already used to modulate DNA G4 folding in vitro. Here, we report that, in human cells, the use of short ASO to promote and  inhibit RNA G4 folding affects the translation of specific mRNAs, including one from the 5'UTR of the H2AFY gene, a histone variant associated with cellular differentiation and cancer. These results suggest that the relatively high specificity of ASO-based strategies holds significant potential for applications  aimed at modulating G4-motif folding.","2015-01","2019-09-07 18:28:29","2019-09-07 18:28:29","","595-606","","1","43","","Nucleic Acids Res","","","","","","","","eng","(c) The Author(s) 2014.

To date, the prediction of potential G-quadruplex structures  (PG4s) has been based almost exclusively on the sequence of interest agreeing with the algorithm Gx-N-1-7-Gx-N1-7-Gx-N1-7-Gx (where x >/= 3 and N = A, U, G or  C). However, many sequences agreeing with this algorithm do not form G4s and are  considered false-positive predictions. Here we show the RNA PG4 candidate in the  3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the TTYH1 gene to be one such false positive. Specifically, G4 folding was observed to be inhibited by the presence of multiple-cytosine tracks, located in the candidate's genomic context, that adopted a Watson-Crick base-paired structure. Clearly, the neighbouring sequences of a PG4 may influence its folding. The secondary structure of 12 PG4 motifs along with either 15 or 50 nucleotides of their upstream and downstream genomic contexts were evaluated by in-line probing. Data permitted the development of a scoring system for the prediction of PG4s taking into account the effect of the neighbouring sequences. The accuracy of this scoring system was assessed by probing 14 other novel PG4 candidates retrieved in human 5'-UTRs. This new scoring system can be used, in combination with the standard algorithm, to better predict the folding of RNA G4s.","2014-01","2019-09-07 18:28:29","2019-09-07 18:28:29","","1209-1223","","2","42","","Nucleic Acids Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 24121682  PMCID: PMC3902908","","","","Algorithms; Base Pairing; Genomics; Humans; HEK293 Cells; *3' Untranslated Regions; *G-Quadruplexes; RNA Folding; Membrane Proteins/genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, to date no RNA species binding a  hormone has been reported. Here, we report that the use of an appropriate SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) strategy results in the isolation of thyroxine-specific aptamers. Further biochemical characterization of these aptamers, including mutational studies, the use of transcripts with site-specific modified nucleotides, nuclease and chemical probing, binding-shift assays and CD, demonstrated that these RNA structures included a G-rich motif, reminiscent of a guanine quadruplex structure, adjacent  to a helical region. The presence of the thyroxine appeared to be essential for the formation of the structural motif's scaffold. Moreover, the binding is shown  to be specific to thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3), the active forms of  the hormone, whereas other inactive derivatives, including thyronine (T0), do not support complex formation.
