      <description>&lt;p&gt;After completing his Bachelor of Science degree in 2009, Amit moved forward with a Master of Science program (Indore, India). He characterized a few bacteria able to degrade pectin and developed growth conditions for higher pectinase production, the enzyme responsible for pectin degradation. Next, Amit joined the doctoral program at the Indian Institute of Science Education &amp;amp; Research Bhopal and joined the lab of Dr. Sanjeev Shukla. During his doctoral program, he identified a novel axis of PAK2-cMyc-PKM2 in head and neck oncogenesis. He also investigated aspects of epigenetic dysregulation and altered mRNA splicing in breast and head and neck cancer. Amit joined the Beaudoin Lab in March 2020 as a postdoctoral fellow, investigating how cis-regulatory elements control mRNA trafficking using different cellular model systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my undergraduate studies at Boston University (’18), where I studied biochemistry and molecular biology, I also took a keen interest in developmental biology while working in the laboratory of Dr. Mikel García-Marcos, investigating how a non-canonical heterotrimeric G protein-activator regulates tissue remodeling and neural tube folding in the early vertebrate embryo. Then, under the direction of Dr. Daniel Cifuentes, I was able to explore how the unique Dicer-independent processing of a particular microRNA allows it to shape terminal erythrocyte differentiation. With a simultaneous ambition to become a physician, I proceeded to pursue a Master of Public Health (‘21) from the University of Connecticut to understand how science and medicine can help mitigate health inequities. During this time, I was also working in the laboratory of Dr. Christine Beck at the Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, where I studied how transposable elements give rise to structural variation and genomic instability, using both molecular biological and bioinformatic approaches. Now, upon entering the MD-PhD program at UConn, I am interested in understanding how post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA orchestrates the fate of a cell, whether it be during early embryonic development or differentiation processes. In the Beaudoin Lab, I am particularly interested in the regulatory framework of 3’ UTRs in the zebrafish maternal-to-zygotic transition.
I like to achieve balance by going on hikes, spinning on my bike, watching tennis, and trying different cuisines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! I am Jean-Denis, a French Canadian who came to the US to complete his Post-doctoral studies at Yale University and who is now joining the UCONN Health team as an Assistant Professor! Here is a little bit about myself. Curiously, I fit most Canadian stereotypes out there. I don’t qualify winter in Connecticut as real winter. I need to play hockey to stay mentally sane. I provide maple syrup to people from the department in the Spring and I love lumberjacking with my grandfather in the Fall. You will see me wearing Montreal Canadiens gears on important game days, but I much prefer American football over Canadian football. When I am not in the lab, I enjoy passing quality time with my family. I have a young son and watching him grow is simply sublime. I am a big craft beer amateur and will venture to new breweries all over the northeast on weekends. I stay connected with the outdoors by hiking, skiing, ice skating, snowshoeing, rollerblading, fishing and more. In short, I practice a good balance between personal and professional life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professionally, I am a very enthusiastic person. I love to share my passion for science with others and discuss about new ideas, experiments, results, recent publications, meetings and more. I completed my B.Sc. in Biotechnology at Université de Sherbrooke (Québec, Canada) and my Ph.D. in Biochemistry in the laboratory of Jean-Pierre Perreault at Université de Sherbrooke (Québec Canada). During my graduate studies, I addressed how do RNA structures control RNA activity? My work discovered novel properties and functions of RNA G-quadruplexes, a structure formed by G-rich sequences. First, I characterized their folding properties and dynamics in vitro (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18456841&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Beaudoin JD, &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; 2008&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;ttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23500045&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Beaudoin JD, &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; 2013&lt;/a&gt;). Next, I developed an algorithm to locate genomic sequences susceptible to form G-quaruplexes (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24121682&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Beaudoin JD,  &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; 2014&lt;/a&gt;) and found that, in human cell cultures, 5’-UTR G-quadruplexes act as key translational repressors (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20571090&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Beaudoin JD and Perreault JP, 2010&lt;/a&gt;) and 3’-UTR G-quadruplexes can modulate alternative polyadenylation leading to differential expression (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23609544&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Beaudoin JD. and Perreault JP., Nucleic Acids Res. 2013&lt;/a&gt;). Together, this work provided mechanistic insights into a previously unrecognized role for RNA G-quadruplexes in gene expression regulation. Following from this work, we developed an oligonucleotide-based approach to target individual RNA G-quadruplexes and tune gene expression in a desired direction (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25510493&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rouleau SG, Beaudoin JD, &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; 2015&lt;/a&gt;). These findings highlighted the potential to target RNA regulatory elements to control gene expression, opening promising novel therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, I started my postdoc in the laboratory of Antonio Giraldez at Yale University. For my postdoctoral work, I extended my expertise in molecular, cellular and RNA biology to study a fundamental process in all animals, the maternal-to-zygotic transition, where post-transcriptional regulation orchestrates a profound change in the embryonic transcriptional landscape. Here, I asked two central questions: what are the RNA structures formed during early embryogenesis and how do they interact with cellular factors to control gene expression during development? To address these questions, I developed innovative genome-wide in vivo RNA probing techniques to gain structural information on the zebrafish transcriptome during embryogenesis. I also expanded my technical repertoire to perform high throughput approaches to measure genome-wide gene expression in vivo, including mRNA abundance (RNA-seq) and translation (Ribo-seq). By integrating this information, I generated a global interaction map between RNA structure, mRNA stability and translation during early embryogenesis (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30061596&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Beaudoin JD*, Novoa EM* &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; 2018.&lt;/a&gt;). Our results provide three major insights: (1) Contrary to the current dogma, we found that untranslated mRNAs are more structured in vivo compared to in vitro, (2) globally, translation guides mRNA structures rather than structure guiding translation (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30061597&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Karmer MC and Gregory BD, 2018.&lt;/a&gt;), and (3) RNA structures remodeled in 3’-UTRs are enriched for regulatory activity during development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I am extremely excited to start my lab at UConn Health in the Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences and can’t wait to see what the future holds!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During undergrad I became interested in developmental biology and human genetic disorders. I worked as research assistant during my B.S./M.S. in the Takacs lab at the University of New Haven, where I assisted with the optimization of CRISPR/cas13d technology for RNA knockdown in animal embryos. As a rotation student in the Beaudoin lab, I am interested in studying post-transcriptional regulation during early embryonic development and applying cas13d technology to its study in animal embryos.
Outside of the lab I am a very active person. I love hiking, mountain biking and weight training. I enjoy video games, music of all genres, exploring new breweries with friends and of course, talking about science wherever possible!&lt;/p&gt;
